# Binder with Clojupyter and Noj

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/behrica/binder-clojupyter/master)

Launches jupyter in Browser via Binder including  [clojupyter](https://github.com/clojupyter/clojupyter) which allow writing Clojure
in Jupyter notebooks.

This is based on a patched clojupyter: https://github.com/clojupyter/clojupyter/pull/187

Contains all data science libraries of [Noj](https://github.com/scicloj/noj) and renders rich visualisations based on [kind](https://scicloj.github.io/kindly-noted/kindly) automatically.
